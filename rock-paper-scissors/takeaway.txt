List of methods used:

.getElementById() - gets element by ID
.querySelectorAll() - to select all the elements of a specific tag/class name
.forEach() - This is used for a nodelist or an array of elements - 
Unlike the previous project,instead of looping all the elements formed as a nodelist to access each element like we have done on the modal window project of Javascript. 
We can use forEach()

There are three choices rock, paper, scissors - user must click a button, an event occurs
For such an event we have created a nodelist using querSelectorAll 
>> const possibleChoices = document.querySelectorAll('button')
>> possibleChoices.forEach(possibleChoice => possibleChoice.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        userChoice = event.target.id;
        userChoiceDisplay.innerHTML = userChoice;
        }




.addEventListener() - method to handle an event
.innerHTML - to change the inner html
.e.target.id - this targets and picks the id of the element on ehich the event is occuring.
Math.floor()
Math.random() - Generates a random number between 0 and 1
